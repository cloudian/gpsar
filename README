This is gpsar. It's a tiny (relatively) shell script that looks at the
servers sar data files, processes them with sadf and runs them through
Gnuplot to generate a series of graphs before creating a HTML summary
which contains the images.

The script is young (currently) and has some basic graphing right now
but it could be better. Feel free to make the graphs prettier and pass
the changes back.
